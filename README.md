# -earthquake-wave-in-PINN
this is a case of seismic wave forward and inversion using PINN(physical-informed neural network)

to install requirements,create a new environment named anything you want,and command line input ：
pip install -r requirements.txt


the case is the case3 in the following paper:
[JGR Solid Earth - 2022 - Rasht‐Behesht - Physics‐Informed Neural Networks  PINNs  for Wave Propagation and Full Waveform.pdf](https://github.com/grayguy2002/-earthquake-wave-in-PINN/files/9421475/JGR.Solid.Earth.-.2022.-.Rasht.Behesht.-.Physics.Informed.Neural.Networks.PINNs.for.Wave.Propagation.and.Full.Waveform.pdf)
